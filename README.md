# 📐 MATLAB Area Estimation Projects

This collection of MATLAB scripts uses the **trapezoidal rule** to approximate the area under a curve over a defined interval. Each script demonstrates numerical integration applied to different functions and panel counts to observe precision and behavior.

## 📁 Files Included

### 🔹 `parabolic_area_estimation.m`
Estimates the area under a parabolic curve defined by **f(x) = 12x² - 9x + 11** from `x = 0.52` to `x = 1.65` using 2,500 panels for high precision.

### 🔹 `abs_sin_7_panels.m`  
Approximates the area under **f(x) = |sin(x)|** from `x = 0` to `2π` using only **7 panels**, illustrating how low panel count affects estimation accuracy.

### 🔹 `abs_sin_600_panels.m`  
Repeats the same calculation as above, but with **600 panels**, greatly increasing precision in the estimation of the same area.
